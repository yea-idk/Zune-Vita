Adventure Bar Labyrinth

Adventure Bar Labyrinth is a rogue-like RPG that challenges you to tackle an unknown dungeon.
To bring back the legendary treasure, you’ll need to enter the depths of the dungeon, find
weapons and shields, and use magic rods and potions to fight against monsters and raise your level.

Each time you enter the dungeon, its structure changes along with the items and monsters within it.
You can challenge the dungeon again and again, even if you’ve already cleared it. If you’re defeated,
the items you obtain will all be lost, and your level will be reset to 1.

The ingredients you collect from the dungeon can be cooked in the bar to make food, granting positive
effects and EXP for the next adventure. Use all sorts of items to deal with the monsters, find rare
treasures and reveal the mystery of the labyrinth!
